The location, Fifth Avenue, the quality - nobody has ever seen anything like it. These prosecutors, they don't understand real estate. They don't understand what location means.

The job we did - and by the way, they raided Mar-a-Lago, can you believe it? The FBI raided Mar-a-Lago. Never happened to a president before.
