                <span class="speaker">HANNITY:</span> Mr. President, thank you for joining us tonight. Let's talk about the recent developments in your case.

                <span class="timestamp">[00:01:20]</span>
                <span class="speaker">TRUMP:</span> Thank you, Sean. You know, this is the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. These radical left prosecutors, they're doing this because they know they can't win at the ballot box.

                <span class="speaker">HANNITY:</span> You've called this election interference. Can you elaborate?

                <span class="timestamp">[00:01:50]</span>
                <span class="speaker">TRUMP:</span> Absolutely. Look at the timing, Sean. It's all timed for the election. They're trying to keep me off the campaign trail, but it's not working. Our poll numbers are higher than ever. The people see through this sham.

                <span class="timestamp">[00:02:15]</span>
                <span class="speaker">TRUMP:</span> And by the way, these prosecutors, they're a disgrace. They're doing this while crime is through the roof in their cities. Look at New York, look at Atlanta - total disasters under Democrat control.

                <span class="timestamp">[00:02:40]</span>
                <span class="speaker">TRUMP:</span> We're going to win, and we're going to win big. The silent majority is bigger than ever. They see what's happening at the border, they see what's happening with inflation - everything Biden touches turns to disaster. We're going to take back our country.
