            <h3>STATEMENT BY DONALD J. TRUMP, 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES</h3>

            <div class="quote-block">
                The latest jobs report proves what every American already knows - Joe Biden's economy is a complete and total disaster. Under my administration, we had the greatest economy in the history of our country, with the lowest unemployment numbers for African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanic Americans ever recorded.
            </div>

            <p>President Trump continued:</p>

            <div class="quote-block">
                Inflation is destroying the middle class, gas prices are through the roof, and our southern border is being invaded by millions of illegal aliens. This would NEVER happen under my watch. When I'm back in the White House, we'll end this madness on DAY ONE!
            </div>

            <p>On his plans for immediate action, the President stated:</p>

            <div class="quote-block">
                We're going to close the border, drill baby drill to lower your gas prices, and bring back AMERICA FIRST trade deals that put American workers first. The Biden administration's policies are a gift to China. When we win in 2024 - and we will win - that all ends!
