It is not an official legal edition of the Federal\n            Register, and does not replace the official print version or the official\n            electronic version on GPO’s govinfo.gov.\n          \n\n          \n            The documents posted on this site are XML renditions of published Federal\n            Register documents. Each document posted on the site includes a link to the\n            corresponding official PDF file on govinfo.gov. This prototype edition of the\n            daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov will remain an unofficial\n            informational resource until the Administrative Committee of the Federal\n            Register (ACFR) issues a regulation granting it official legal status.\n            For complete information about, and access to, our official publications\n            and services, go to\n            \n              About the Federal Register\n            \n             on NARA's archives.gov.\n          \n\n          \n            The OFR/GPO partnership is committed to presenting accurate and reliable\n            regulatory information on FederalRegister.gov with the objective of\n            establishing the XML-based Federal Register as an ACFR-sanctioned\n            publication in the future. While every effort has been made to ensure that\n            the material on FederalRegister.gov is accurately displayed, consistent with\n            the official SGML-based PDF version on govinfo.gov, those relying on it for\n            legal research should verify their results against an official edition of\n            the Federal Register. Until the ACFR grants it official status, the XML\n            rendition of the daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov does not\n            provide legal notice to the public or judicial notice to the courts.\n          \nLegal Status      \n\n        \n  Presidential Document\n\n\n\n      \n  \n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n        \n          \n            \n            \n             Enter a search term or FR citation e.g. \n              \n              88 FR 382\n                30 FR 7878\n                2024-13208\n                USDA\n                09/05/24\n                RULE\n                0503-AA39\n                SORN\n              \n            \n            \n              Choosing an item from\n              full text search results\n              will bring you to those results.

(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 \n                    et seq.)

BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that the current existence and risk of the proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. I further find that, as we deal with that threat through multilateral diplomacy, it is necessary to continue certain restrictions with respect to North Korea that would otherwise be lifted pursuant to a forthcoming proclamation that will terminate the exercise of authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1 \n                    et seq.) (TWEA) with respect to North Korea. \n                \n                Accordingly, I hereby order: \n                \n                    Section 1.\n                     Except to the extent provided in statutes or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the date of this order, the following are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: \n                \n                all property and interests in property of North Korea or a North Korean national that, pursuant to the President's authorities under the TWEA, the exercise of which has been continued in accordance with section 101(b) of Public Law 95-223 (91 Stat. 1625; 50 U.S.C. App. 5(b) note), were blocked as of June 16, 2000, and remained blocked immediately prior to the date of this order. \n                \n                    Sec. 2.\n                     Except to the extent provided in statutes or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the date of this order, United States persons may not register a vessel in North Korea, obtain authorization for a vessel to fly the North Korean flag, or own, lease, operate, or insure any vessel flagged by North Korea. \n                \n                \n                    Sec. 3.\n                     (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. \n                \n                (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. \n                \n                    Sec. 4.\n                     For the purposes of this order: \n                \n                (a) the term “person” means an individual or entity; \n                (b) the term “entity” means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and \n                \n                    (c) the term “United States person” means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States. \n                    \n\n      ( print page 36788)\n    \n                \n                \n                    Sec. 5.\n                     The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order.
