It is not an official legal edition of the Federal\n            Register, and does not replace the official print version or the official\n            electronic version on GPO’s govinfo.gov.\n          \n\n          \n            The documents posted on this site are XML renditions of published Federal\n            Register documents. Each document posted on the site includes a link to the\n            corresponding official PDF file on govinfo.gov. This prototype edition of the\n            daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov will remain an unofficial\n            informational resource until the Administrative Committee of the Federal\n            Register (ACFR) issues a regulation granting it official legal status.\n            For complete information about, and access to, our official publications\n            and services, go to\n            \n              About the Federal Register\n            \n             on NARA's archives.gov.\n          \n\n          \n            The OFR/GPO partnership is committed to presenting accurate and reliable\n            regulatory information on FederalRegister.gov with the objective of\n            establishing the XML-based Federal Register as an ACFR-sanctioned\n            publication in the future. While every effort has been made to ensure that\n            the material on FederalRegister.gov is accurately displayed, consistent with\n            the official SGML-based PDF version on govinfo.gov, those relying on it for\n            legal research should verify their results against an official edition of\n            the Federal Register. Until the ACFR grants it official status, the XML\n            rendition of the daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov does not\n            provide legal notice to the public or judicial notice to the courts.\n          \nLegal Status      \n\n        \n  Presidential Document\n\n\n\n      \n  \n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n        \n          \n            \n            \n             Enter a search term or FR citation e.g. \n              \n              88 FR 382\n                30 FR 7878\n                2024-13208\n                USDA\n                09/05/24\n                RULE\n                0503-AA39\n                SORN\n              \n            \n            \n              Choosing an item from\n              full text search results\n              will bring you to those results.

Established by visionary leaders, America's HBCUs, for over 150 years, have produced many of the Nation's leaders in business, government, academia, and the military and have provided generations of American men and women with hope and educational opportunity. The Nation's 105 HBCUs are located in 20 States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands and serve more than 300,000 undergraduate and graduate students. These institutions continue to be important engines of economic growth and community service, and they are proven ladders of intergenerational advancement for men and women of all ethnic, racial, and economic backgrounds, especially African Americans. These institutions also produce a high number of baccalaureate recipients who go on to assume leadership and service roles in their communities and who successfully complete graduate and professional degree programs.\n                    \n                    \n                        Sec. 2.\n                          \n                        White House Initiative on HBCUs.\n                    \n                        (a) \n                        Establishment. \n                        There is established the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (Initiative), to be housed in the Department of Education (Department).\n                    \n                    \n                        (b) \n                        Mission and Functions. \n                        The Initiative shall work with executive departments, agencies, and offices, the private sector, educational associations, philanthropic organizations, and other partners to increase the capacity of HBCUs to provide the highest-quality education to a greater number of students, and to take advantage of these institutions' capabilities in serving the Nation's needs through five core tasks:\n                    \n                    (i) strengthening the capacity of HBCUs to participate in Federal programs;\n                    (ii) fostering enduring private-sector initiatives and public-private partnerships while promoting specific areas and centers of academic research and programmatic excellence throughout all HBCUs;\n                    (iii) improving the availability, dissemination, and quality of information concerning HBCUs to inform public policy and practice;\n                    (iv) sharing administrative and programmatic practices within the HBCU community for the benefit of all; and\n                    (v) exploring new ways of improving the relationship between the Federal Government and HBCUs.\n                    \n                        (c) \n                        Administration. \n                        There shall be an Executive Director of the Initiative.

Where appropriate, each agency plan shall address, among other things, the agency's proposed efforts to:\n                    \n                    (i) establish how the department or agency intends to increase the capacity of HBCUs to compete effectively for grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements and to encourage HBCUs to participate in Federal programs;\n                    (ii) identify Federal programs and initiatives in which HBCUs may be either underserved or underused as national resources, and improve HBCUs' participation therein; and\n                    (iii) encourage public-sector, private-sector, and community involvement in improving the overall capacity of HBCUs.\n                    (2) Each department and agency, in its agency plan, shall provide appropriate measurable objectives and, after the first year, shall annually assess that department's or agency's performance on the goals set in the previous year's agency plan.\n                    (3) The Secretary shall establish a date by which agency plans shall be submitted to the Secretary. The Secretary and the Executive Director shall review the agency plans in consultation with the President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs, established in section 3 of this order, and shall submit to the President an annual plan to strengthen the overall capacity of HBCUs.\n                    (4) To help fulfill the objectives of these plans, the head of each department and agency identified by the Secretary shall provide, as appropriate, technical assistance and information to the Executive Director for purposes of communicating with HBCUs concerning program activities of the department or agency and the preparation of applications or proposals for grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements.\n                    (5) To help fulfill the goals of this order, each executive department and agency identified by the Secretary shall appoint a senior official to report directly to the department or agency head with respect to that department's or agency's activities under this order, and to serve as liaison to the President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs and to the Initiative.\n                    \n                        (e) \n                        Interagency Working Group. \n                        There is established the Interagency Working Group, which shall be convened by the Executive Director and that shall consist of representatives from agencies designated by the Secretary, to help advance and coordinate the work of Federal agencies pursuant to this order, where appropriate.\n                    \n                    \n                        Sec. 3.\n                          \n                        President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs.\n                    \n                        (a) \n                        Establishment. \n                        There is established in the Department the President's Board of Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (the Board).
