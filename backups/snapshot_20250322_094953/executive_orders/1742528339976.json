It is not an official legal edition of the Federal\n            Register, and does not replace the official print version or the official\n            electronic version on GPO’s govinfo.gov.\n          \n\n          \n            The documents posted on this site are XML renditions of published Federal\n            Register documents. Each document posted on the site includes a link to the\n            corresponding official PDF file on govinfo.gov. This prototype edition of the\n            daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov will remain an unofficial\n            informational resource until the Administrative Committee of the Federal\n            Register (ACFR) issues a regulation granting it official legal status.\n            For complete information about, and access to, our official publications\n            and services, go to\n            \n              About the Federal Register\n            \n             on NARA's archives.gov.\n          \n\n          \n            The OFR/GPO partnership is committed to presenting accurate and reliable\n            regulatory information on FederalRegister.gov with the objective of\n            establishing the XML-based Federal Register as an ACFR-sanctioned\n            publication in the future. While every effort has been made to ensure that\n            the material on FederalRegister.gov is accurately displayed, consistent with\n            the official SGML-based PDF version on govinfo.gov, those relying on it for\n            legal research should verify their results against an official edition of\n            the Federal Register. Until the ACFR grants it official status, the XML\n            rendition of the daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov does not\n            provide legal notice to the public or judicial notice to the courts.\n          \nLegal Status      \n\n        \n  Presidential Document\n\n\n\n      \n  \n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n        \n          \n            \n            \n             Enter a search term or FR citation e.g. \n              \n              88 FR 382\n                30 FR 7878\n                2024-13208\n                USDA\n                09/05/24\n                RULE\n                0503-AA39\n                SORN\n              \n            \n            \n              Choosing an item from\n              full text search results\n              will bring you to those results.

The text, “NCUA,” in white on a blue background on the crest of the shield is the core of the sign that federally insured credit unions are required to display.\n                (ii) The three stars above the eagle represent the NCUA's three-member Board, appointed by the President of the United States by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n                (iii) The oak branch the eagle is holding in its left talon symbolizes the NCUA's strength, honor, and longevity in carrying out its mission of promoting confidence in the national system of cooperative credit.\n                (iv) The olive branch the eagle is holding in its right talon symbolizes the peace and prosperity facilitated by the economic growth and access to affordable financial services that the Nation's credit unions have long provided to millions of Americans.\n                (v) The upper portion of the circle that forms the border of the seal sets forth the agency's title, “National Credit Union Administration.” The date “1934” in the lower portion of the circle reflects the creation of the Federal credit union system by the Congress in 1934 and the long unbroken line of Federal credit union regulation that evolved into the NCUA.\n                (b) This seal is of suitable design and appropriate for adoption as the official seal of the NCUA.\n                (c) I hereby approve this seal as the official seal of the NCUA.\n                \n                    Sec. 2\n                    . \n                    Revocation.Executive Order 11580 of January 20, 1971 (Establishing a Seal for the National Credit Union Administration), as amended, is hereby revoked.\n                \n                \n                    Sec. 3\n                    . \n                    General Provisions.\n                     (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n                \n                (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n                (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n                \n                    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n                    \n\n      ( print page 58702)\n    \n                \n                (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n                \n                    \n                \n                 \n                THE WHITE HOUSE,\n                December 8, 2017.\n                \n                \n                    \n\n      ( print page 58703)\n    \n                    \n                \n                \n                Filed 12-12-17; 11:15 a.m.]\n                \n            \n        \nBilling code 3295-F8-P\n[FR Doc. 2017-27034\nBilling code 7535-01-C\n\n\n      \nPublished Document: 2017-27034 (82 FR 58701)",
