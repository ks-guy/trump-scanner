It is not an official legal edition of the Federal\n            Register, and does not replace the official print version or the official\n            electronic version on GPO’s govinfo.gov.\n          \n\n          \n            The documents posted on this site are XML renditions of published Federal\n            Register documents. Each document posted on the site includes a link to the\n            corresponding official PDF file on govinfo.gov. This prototype edition of the\n            daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov will remain an unofficial\n            informational resource until the Administrative Committee of the Federal\n            Register (ACFR) issues a regulation granting it official legal status.\n            For complete information about, and access to, our official publications\n            and services, go to\n            \n              About the Federal Register\n            \n             on NARA's archives.gov.\n          \n\n          \n            The OFR/GPO partnership is committed to presenting accurate and reliable\n            regulatory information on FederalRegister.gov with the objective of\n            establishing the XML-based Federal Register as an ACFR-sanctioned\n            publication in the future. While every effort has been made to ensure that\n            the material on FederalRegister.gov is accurately displayed, consistent with\n            the official SGML-based PDF version on govinfo.gov, those relying on it for\n            legal research should verify their results against an official edition of\n            the Federal Register. Until the ACFR grants it official status, the XML\n            rendition of the daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov does not\n            provide legal notice to the public or judicial notice to the courts.\n          \nLegal Status      \n\n        \n  Presidential Document\n\n\n\n      \n  \n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n        \n          \n            \n            \n             Enter a search term or FR citation e.g. \n              \n              88 FR 382\n                30 FR 7878\n                2024-13208\n                USDA\n                09/05/24\n                RULE\n                0503-AA39\n                SORN\n              \n            \n            \n              Choosing an item from\n              full text search results\n              will bring you to those results.

A nonadversarial forum for managers, employees, and employees' union representatives to discuss Government operations will promote satisfactory labor relations and improve the productivity and effectiveness of the Federal Government. Labor-management forums, as complements to the existing collective bargaining process, will allow managers and employees to collaborate in continuing to deliver the highest quality services to the American people. Management should discuss workplace challenges and problems with labor and endeavor to develop solutions jointly, rather than advise union representatives of predetermined solutions to problems and then engage in bargaining over the impact and implementation of the predetermined solutions.\n                    \n                    The purpose of this order is to establish a cooperative and productive form of labor-management relations throughout the executive branch.\n                    \n                        Sec. 2.\n                          \n                        The National Council on Federal Labor-Management Relations. \n                        There is established the National Council on Federal Labor-Management Relations (Council).\n                    \n                    \n                        (a) \n                        Membership. \n                        The Council shall be composed of the following members appointed or designated by the President:\n                    \n                    (i) the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), who shall serve as Co-Chairs of the Council;\n                    (ii) the Chair of the Federal Labor Relations Authority;\n                    (iii) a Deputy Secretary or other officer with department- or agency-wide authority from each of five executive departments or agencies not otherwise represented on the Council, who shall serve for terms of 2 years;\n                    (iv) the President of the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO;\n                    (v) the President of the National Federation of Federal Employees;\n                    (vi) the President of the National Treasury Employees Union;\n                    (vii) the President of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO;\n                    (viii) the heads of three other labor unions that represent Federal employees and are not otherwise represented on the Council, who shall serve for terms of 2 years;\n                    (ix) the President of the Senior Executives Association; and\n                    (x) the President of the Federal Managers Association.\n                    \n                        (b) \n                        Responsibilities and Functions. \n                        The Council shall advise the President on matters involving labor-management relations in the executive branch. Its activities shall include, to the extent permitted by law:\n                    \n                    \n                        (i) supporting the creation of department- or agency-level labor-management forums and promoting partnership efforts between labor and management in the executive branch;\n                        \n\n      ( print page 66204)\n    \n                    \n                    (ii) developing suggested measurements and metrics for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the Council and department or agency labor-management forums in order to promote consistent, appropriate, and administratively efficient measurement and evaluation processes across departments and agencies;\n                    (iii) collecting and disseminating information about, and providing guidance on, labor-management relations improvement efforts in the executive branch, including results achieved;\n                    (iv) utilizing the expertise of individuals both within and outside the Federal Government to foster successful labor-management relations, including through training of department and agency personnel in methods of dispute resolution and cooperative methods of labor-management relations;\n                    (v) developing recommendations for innovative ways to improve delivery of services and  products to the public while cutting costs and advancing employee interests;\n                    (vi) serving as a venue for addressing systemic failures of department- or agency-level forums established pursuant to section 3 of this order; and\n                    (vii) providing recommendations to the President for the implementation of several pilot programs within the executive branch, described in section 4 of this order, for bargaining over subjects set forth in 5 U.S.C. 7106(b)(1).\n                    \n                        (c) \n                        Administration.\n                    \n                    (i) The Co-Chairs shall convene and preside at meetings of the Council, determine its agenda, and direct its work.\n                    (ii) The Council shall seek input from nonmember executive departments and agencies, particularly smaller agencies.
