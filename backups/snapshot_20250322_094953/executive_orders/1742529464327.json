It is not an official legal edition of the Federal\n            Register, and does not replace the official print version or the official\n            electronic version on GPO’s govinfo.gov.\n          \n\n          \n            The documents posted on this site are XML renditions of published Federal\n            Register documents. Each document posted on the site includes a link to the\n            corresponding official PDF file on govinfo.gov. This prototype edition of the\n            daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov will remain an unofficial\n            informational resource until the Administrative Committee of the Federal\n            Register (ACFR) issues a regulation granting it official legal status.\n            For complete information about, and access to, our official publications\n            and services, go to\n            \n              About the Federal Register\n            \n             on NARA's archives.gov.\n          \n\n          \n            The OFR/GPO partnership is committed to presenting accurate and reliable\n            regulatory information on FederalRegister.gov with the objective of\n            establishing the XML-based Federal Register as an ACFR-sanctioned\n            publication in the future. While every effort has been made to ensure that\n            the material on FederalRegister.gov is accurately displayed, consistent with\n            the official SGML-based PDF version on govinfo.gov, those relying on it for\n            legal research should verify their results against an official edition of\n            the Federal Register. Until the ACFR grants it official status, the XML\n            rendition of the daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov does not\n            provide legal notice to the public or judicial notice to the courts.\n          \nLegal Status      \n\n        \n  Presidential Document\n\n\n\n      \n  \n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n        \n          \n            \n            \n             Enter a search term or FR citation e.g. \n              \n              88 FR 382\n                30 FR 7878\n                2024-13208\n                USDA\n                09/05/24\n                RULE\n                0503-AA39\n                SORN\n              \n            \n            \n              Choosing an item from\n              full text search results\n              will bring you to those results.

and\n                (c) pursue appropriate legislation, consistent with the Constitution's regime of limited and enumerated Federal powers, that will define new Federal crimes, and increase penalties for existing Federal crimes, in order to prevent violence against Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement officers.\n                \n                    Sec. 2\n                    . \n                    Implementation.\n                     In furtherance of the policy set forth in section 1 of this order, the Attorney General shall:\n                \n                (a) develop a strategy for the Department's use of existing Federal laws to prosecute individuals who commit or attempt to commit crimes of violence against Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement officers;\n                (b) coordinate with State, tribal, and local governments, and with law enforcement agencies at all levels, including other Federal agencies, in prosecuting crimes of violence against Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement officers in order to advance adequate multi-jurisdiction prosecution efforts;\n                (c) review existing Federal laws to determine whether those laws are adequate to address the protection and safety of Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement officers;\n                (d) following that review, and in coordination with other Federal agencies, as appropriate, make recommendations to the President for legislation to address the protection and safety of Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement officers, including, if warranted, legislation defining new crimes of violence and establishing new mandatory minimum sentences for existing crimes of violence against Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement officers, as well as for related crimes;\n                (e) coordinate with other Federal agencies to develop an executive branch strategy to prevent violence against Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement officers;\n                (f) thoroughly evaluate all grant funding programs currently administered by the Department to determine the extent to which its grant funding supports and protects Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement officers;
