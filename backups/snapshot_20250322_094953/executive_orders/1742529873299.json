It is not an official legal edition of the Federal\n            Register, and does not replace the official print version or the official\n            electronic version on GPO’s govinfo.gov.\n          \n\n          \n            The documents posted on this site are XML renditions of published Federal\n            Register documents. Each document posted on the site includes a link to the\n            corresponding official PDF file on govinfo.gov. This prototype edition of the\n            daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov will remain an unofficial\n            informational resource until the Administrative Committee of the Federal\n            Register (ACFR) issues a regulation granting it official legal status.\n            For complete information about, and access to, our official publications\n            and services, go to\n            \n              About the Federal Register\n            \n             on NARA's archives.gov.\n          \n\n          \n            The OFR/GPO partnership is committed to presenting accurate and reliable\n            regulatory information on FederalRegister.gov with the objective of\n            establishing the XML-based Federal Register as an ACFR-sanctioned\n            publication in the future. While every effort has been made to ensure that\n            the material on FederalRegister.gov is accurately displayed, consistent with\n            the official SGML-based PDF version on govinfo.gov, those relying on it for\n            legal research should verify their results against an official edition of\n            the Federal Register. Until the ACFR grants it official status, the XML\n            rendition of the daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov does not\n            provide legal notice to the public or judicial notice to the courts.\n          \nLegal Status      \n\n        \n  Presidential Document\n\n\n\n      \n  \n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n        \n          \n            \n            \n             Enter a search term or FR citation e.g. \n              \n              88 FR 382\n                30 FR 7878\n                2024-13208\n                USDA\n                09/05/24\n                RULE\n                0503-AA39\n                SORN\n              \n            \n            \n              Choosing an item from\n              full text search results\n              will bring you to those results.
